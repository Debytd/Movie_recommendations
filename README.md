## Definition 
Creating a platform that collects movie information through simple questions to suggest personalized options to the user is a great way to help people find movies they might enjoy. By asking questions like movie length and genre of interest, the platform could filter the options and provide accurate and relevant suggestions to the user. In addition, the platform could also include user feedback and ratings so that users can make informed decisions.

## Objectives
- Collect relevant information from movies: Collect detailed information about movies, such as genre, duration, plot, cast, rating, etc.
- Offer personalized recommendations: Once the user's information has been collected through a short questionnaire, the algorithm can provide movie recommendations that fit the user's tastes. The personalized recommendation can increase user satisfaction and increase the likelihood that they will return to the page.
- Create an engaging user experience: By making the movie search process easier and more comfortable for the user, you can create a more engaging user experience.
